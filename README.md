# fb_chat_example

A small chat app showing how to use firebase and firestore.

In order to use it, you need to connect a firebase project to the app. You can do this by following the instructions on the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

In short, run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
flutterfire configure --project=<firebase-project-name>
```

Messages from other users need to be added by hand in firestore, for the time being.
